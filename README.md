## Descritpion
- In this prototype, each form field uses the FormField abstraction that accepts field attributes, type(text field, date picker, etc), and optional custom validator. 
- The order of the form fields and grouping are fully customizable in a FormSection model. The validation kicks in every time the value in each field is updated using observer. The save button will be enabled only if all the form fields are valid.

## Usage
- Clone the project
- Run pod install
- Build and Run the project
